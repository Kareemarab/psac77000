			<p style="color: #000;">PSAC local 77000, otherwise known as the Carleton University Postdoctoral Union (CUPU),
			represents Postdoctoral Fellows whose internal funding is equal or greater than 50% of the minimum annual salary
			stipulated in the collective agreement, or its pro-rated equivalent.<br>
			We are Postdocs like you who work to uphold and improve our working conditions.<br><br>
			The work of the local is done through an <a href="{{ url('/contactus') }}">Executive Committee</a> made up of
			peers which we elect at general membership meetings.<br><br>
			Our local <a href="../docs/PDF_A.pdf">bylaws</a> help to guide how the local functions. We, the members,
			also vote to adopt and amend the bylaws.<br><br>
			Our work contract, also called the <a href="../docs/PDF_CA.pdf">Collective Agreement</a> is a legally-binding
			contract. We negotiate it with the employer on a cyclical basis. We get to vote to accept, or not to accept,
			the contract which the parties present us with (visit the <a href="{{ url('/collective') }}">Collective Bargaining</a>
			tab for more information). The collective agreement stipulates our rights and responsibilities as employees, as well
			as the rights and responsibilities of our employer towards us.
