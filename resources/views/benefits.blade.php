				<h3>Professional Development Fund</h3>

				Article 13.06 of the Collective Agreement between Carleton University and PSAC77000 provides for a Professional Development Fund (PDF) for Postdoctoral Fellows. In order to be eligible for the PDF, the postdoc fellow must be active (the postdoc contract has to be valid during the time of the avail of the PDF).
				<br><br>
				The Professional Development Fund (PDF) supports professional development activities of  postdoctoral fellows at Carleton University that are otherwise not provided to them by  their supervisor(s) at Carleton University.  Examples of such professional development activities include travel, accommodation and registration fees for conferences related to professional development (e.g. teaching related conferences, grant writing workshops, ...).  Original receipts must be supplied in all instances in order to obtain reimbursement. If your travel to a conference is by air, you must also provide your original boarding passes in order to obtain reimbursement.
				<br><br>
				The PDF is administered by the Joint Committee for the Administration of the Agreement (JCAA) that comprises members from the University and PSAC77000. The maximum amount that you may apply for and receive in a single year is $1500. The year is defined from May 1st of one calendar year to April 30th of the next calendar year.
				Note: the reimbursement can only take place after the expense has been incurred.
				<br><br>
				To apply for the PDF:
				<br><br>
				1) fill out the PDF application <a href="../docs/PDF_A_form.pdf">form</a> explaining how the expenses are related to your professional development;
				<br><br>
				2) send by email the completed form to JCAA.PSAC77000@gmail.com . Do NOT email any receipts with the application form;
				<br><br>
				3) PSAC and the University will review your application and reply to you within 5 weeks. If approved, PSAC 77000 will email you the approved application form along with further instructions.
				Note: You may submit your application some months in advance to find out if you will be eligible for receiving the funds or not for a professional development opportunity of your choice.
				<br><br>

The academic year begins on September 1st  of one calendar year and ends on August 31st  of the following calendar year and is divided into three terms: Fall term (September-December), Winter term (January-April) and Summer term (May-August). The Tuition Waiver may be applied to courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level.

				2) If you do not currently hold any kind of student status (most Postdoctoral Fellows do not have a student status, either full-time or part-time) then please contact by email the Registrar's Office in order to (a) request for a "Special Student" status and (b) indicate them the course in which you wish to register in. Their contact information is listed at https://carleton.ca/registrar/contact-us/
				Note: There is a fee associated with this request.
				<br><br>

				<br><br>
				4) Once you have registered in the course, check the amount due to be paid on Carleton Central. The tuition waiver ONLY covers the fee for a 0.5 credit course. You will incur other related university dues listed in your account balance that you will have to pay out of your pocket.

				<br><br>
				6) Bring the paper form to the Registrarâ€™s Office at 300 Tory Building (open Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) in order to obtain verification signature (section D) ;
				<br><br>
				7) Submit the completed paper form in person to Student Accounts, 301 Robertson Hall.
